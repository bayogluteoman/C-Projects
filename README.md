##CONTRIBUTIONS OF EACH MEMBER

<p>Teoman Bayoglu:</p> Hakan and I created database and he sent me database
tables (realtor, house and house_owner ). I created “dbConnection.cs” for
get, open and close connection. Also I created “Database.cs” for get data
and insert data for other forms. I created “Realtor.cs” for “LoginForm.cs”.
Login Form take insert and operations from People.cs. Realtor can add
house owner in “HouseOwnerForm.cs”. This form take insert, update and
delete operations from “People.cs”. I used DataGridview for see datas in
here. If user click once to “Show Details” button or click to cell in
DataGridview, s/he can see owner’s information in textboxes. It’s optional
for update and remove operations. I put a counter below the DataGridview.
Additionally user can see house details of this owner, if s/he click double
to “Show Details” button in this form after house details added. I created
“DetailsListForm.cs” for show the house details. Also I used
“HouseDetailsForm.cs” which is related with “Property.cs” for add house
details. I created “Property.cs” for take insert, update and delete
operations. I used DataGridview for see datas in here. In this form we can
see house owner with “Select Owner” button for add house details for this
owner. When user write house id, user can see all house details in
textboxes thanks to “Search Button”. Also for remove and update
operations, users must write first House Id.<hr/>
<p>Eren Onur Karaaslan:</p> The general design of our forms and the layout of
controls were under my responsibility. We had 3 different designs in total
until we reached our final design. Our first design was just a demo and
poorly designed. Our first demo was designed to let my team members
work on project. Later on, we exchanged ideas. And they gave me some
feedback through missing functionalities about first design. Then I started
to work on our second design and I completed the missing parts. Also I
made some improvements in terms of design. I shared the second design
with my team members and took break for a while to let them work on
it.After most of the feature and code piece required for the project is filled
by my team members,I started working to take our design to the next
level.I tried to fix the parts that looked bad in our previous design and I
tried to have a user-friendly design. I was always in touch with my friends
during the development of these 3 designs. After my last design, my
teammates made some additions and we completed the project by making
our final edits<hr/>
<p>Hakan Kadakal:</p>First of all my and all of my groupmates’ main goal was to
communicate and help each other in any way. We had our work shared in
the beginning of the project. Me and Teoman oversaw creating a database
and have a stabilized data exchange between our project and our
database. We had irregular but frequent meetings with him. Unfortunately
my own computer had broken down at that time and all I can do was to do
research and help Teoman building the database in our meetings. After
the computer problem is solved, I created a registration form to sign up to
our Real Estate System. And helped Teoman building the form interaction
with the database. Besides all of this we 3 three of us had many
conversations about the design of our form.<hr/>
 GENERAL REPORT

Before we can reach to our final design, we had 3 total designs. First
design was just a demo and it was poorly designed. But it was prepared in
order to work with the database. We had a lot of information exchange
between us about the design so we had many changes throughout this
project. We all showed solidarity during this process and finally had this
plain and uncomplicated design. We are aware that this project has many
aspects that can be improved. Because we made it from scratch and we
didn’t had any projects or designs as references. We tried to provide
pictures of our houses to the user but we couldn’t have much time for this
feature to work like we wanted it to. We tried to improve our project until
the submission time and we demonstrated a proper teamwork<hr/>
